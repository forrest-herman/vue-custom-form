This is a project making use of the article **[Building an Interactive and Distraction-free Form with Vue](https://medium.com/vue-mastery/building-an-interactive-and-distraction-free-form-with-vue-bfe23907e981)**.

This implementation uses a JSON file to generate the custom form. In our use case, the JSON file is fetched via a wagtail site, where the form can be created using the wagtail CMS login.
